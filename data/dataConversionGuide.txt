*DATA SOURCE UPDATE SCRIPT OVERVIEW/INSTRUCTIONS*
*************************************************

The Python script in this directory, when run, carries out two tasks.
First, it searches through each of the subdirectories, finds the raw 
data (.dat) files, reads the files, then outputs a .json file based 
on the data.  Second, it updates the index.json file to include the 
newly created .json file and its relevant metadata.  This index.json
file tells the WebCHIP application where to find each dataset.

In order to add new data files/directories, take the following steps:

	1. Add the the new data file(s) to the appropriate subdirectory.
	   If the subdirectory does not exist yet, create it and add the
	   new file(s).  Be sure that each file ends with a .dat file
	   extension; if the file ends with another extension, the script
	   will the skip the file and you will not be able to use the dataset
	   in WebCHIP.

	2. Using the terminal, navigate to the 'data' folder in the project
	   directory, and enter "python parseFiles.py".  This will run the
	   Python script described above, creating a .json file from the 
	   .dat file.  The time it takes for the script to run depends on 
	   the number of files added, but will typically take a couple of 
	   minutes.

	3. If you wish to remove the .dat file after the .json has been 
	   converted, enter "rm -r <name of file>.dat".  If many files
	   have been added and you want to remove them all, enter "rm -r *.dat"

After these steps, all files have been converted and the application will 
be ready to use with the new datasets.
